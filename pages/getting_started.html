            <h3>Creating a GitHub Account</h3>
            <p>To get started with GitHub, you first need to create a GitHub account. This will allow you to host and
                manage your code repositories, collaborate with other developers, and use many other features of GitHub.
            </p>

            <h3>Installing and Configuring Git</h3>
            <p>You will also need to install Git on your local machine. Git is a version control system that lets you
                manage and keep track of your source code history. After installing Git, you need to configure it to
                connect to your GitHub account.</p>

            <h3>What is a Repository?</h3>
            <p>A repository is like a project folder where you store all your project files. It also includes all the
                version control history of your project.</p>

            <h3>Creating a New Repository</h3>
            <p>You can create a new repository on GitHub to start a new project. When creating a new repository, you can
                choose to initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license.</p>

            <h3>What is GitHub Pages?</h3>
            <p>GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a
                repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.</p>

            <h3>Creating a GitHub Pages Site</h3>
            <p>To create a GitHub Pages site, you need to create a new repository (or use an existing one), push your
                site files to the repository, and then configure your repository settings to use GitHub Pages.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
            <h3>What is a Pull Request?</h3>
            <p>Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once
                a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add
                follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.</p>

            <h3>Creating a Pull Request</h3>
            <p>To create a pull request, you need to have made your changes in a separate branch. This branch should be
                based on the branch you wish to merge your changes into.</p>

            <h3>Merging a Pull Request</h3>
            <p>Once your pull request has been reviewed and the branch passes your tests, you can send your pull
                request. Anyone with push access to the repository can complete the merge.</p>

            <h3>What are GitHub Issues?</h3>
            <p>Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They’re kind of
                like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team.</p>

            <h3>Creating an Issue</h3>
            <p>Anyone with read access to a repository can create an issue. If you have write access to a repository,
                you can assign the issue to someone else.</p>

            <h3>Closing an Issue</h3>
            <p>You can close an issue directly from a commit if you include certain keywords in your commit message.</p>
