                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work
                    together on projects from anywhere. This platform enables developers to review code, manage
                    projects, and build software alongside millions of other developers. GitHub is where over 65 million
                    developers shape the future of software, together. It's a platform for the developers, by the
                    developers.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Set up a GitHub account</h3>
                <p>Visit the <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub sign up page</a>. You can choose a personal
                    account or a business account. You'll need to provide a username, email address, and password. Your
                    username is your identity on GitHub. Your email address is used to verify your account and to send
                    you notifications. You'll need to use a password to keep your account secure. After you complete the
                    signup process, you'll receive an email to verify your email address.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Create a new repository</h3>
                <p>A repository is like a place or a container where something is stored; in this case we're creating a
                    place where we can store our project. You can create a new repository by clicking on the '+' sign in
                    the upper right corner of any page, and then select 'New repository'. Name your repository, write a
                    short description, and choose to make the repository either public or private. You can also
                    initialize it with a README file, add .gitignore, or choose a license.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Create a branch</h3>
                <p>Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. By default your
                    repository has one branch named main which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use
                    branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main. When you create a branch off
                    the main branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. If
                    someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull
                    in those updates.</p>

                <h3>Step 4: Make and commit changes</h3>
                <p>On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a
                    description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your
                    changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why. You can make and commit
                    changes on GitHub by navigating to the file in your repository that you want to change, clicking the
                    pencil icon to edit the file, making your changes, and then committing them with a meaningful commit
                    message.</p>

                <h3>Step 5: Open a Pull Request</h3>
                <p>Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re
                    proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge
                    them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches.
                    The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red. After you make your changes,
                    you can open a pull request for that branch. You can specify a specific person for review, label,
                    project, or milestone.</p>

                <h3>Step 6: Merge your Pull Request</h3>
                <p>In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging your readme-edits branch into
                    the main branch. You can merge your pull request by navigating to the original pull request,
                    clicking the 'Merge pull request' button, then clicking 'Confirm merge'. Once you merge a pull
                    request, you can delete the branch where you made your changes, because its changes have been
                    incorporated into the main branch.</p>
